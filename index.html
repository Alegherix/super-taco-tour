        <p>
          Society has put up so many boundaries, so many limitations on what’s
          right and wrong that it’s almost impossible to get a pure thought out.
          It’s like a little kid, a little boy, looking at colors, and no one
          told him what colors are good, before somebody tells you you shouldn’t
          like pink because that’s for girls, or you’d instantly become a gay
          two-year-old.

            The time is now for it to be okay to be great. People in this world

          If everything I did failed - which it doesn't, it actually succeeds -
          just the fact that I'm willing to fail is an inspiration. People are
          so scared to lose that they don't even try. Like, one thing people
          can't say is that I'm not trying, and I'm not trying my hardest, and
          I'm not trying to do the best way I know how.
